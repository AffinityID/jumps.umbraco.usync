Known Behavior - uSync 2.1. for umbraco 7
=========================================

Macro - (works well on v7)

	the key is the alias, so if you change the alias, you will get
	a new macro at the other end not a rename.

	the properties key of the alias to, if you rename the alias, then
	usync will create a new propery but it will think you deleted the
	old one. the effect is the same but you actually get a new
	property.

DataTypes - 
	
	You can't change the type of a datatype once it's been synced
  	(because the functions are internal to umbraco only)

	PreValuing is using the dataservice - need to see what this does
	with some of the more exotic datatypes.
