Known Behavior - uSync 2.2. for umbraco 7
=========================================

Macro - (works well on v7)

	the key is the alias, so if you change the alias, you will get
	a new macro at the other end not a rename.

	the properties key of the alias to, if you rename the alias, then
	usync will create a new propery but it will think you deleted the
	old one. the effect is the same but you actually get a new
	property.

DataTypes - 
	
	You can't change the type of a datatype once it's been synced
  	(because the functions are internal to umbraco only)

	PreValuing is using the dataservice - need to see what this does
	with some of the more exotic datatypes.

Templates -
Stylesheets -

	the actual contents of the files is only synced when the file
	doesn't exist (i.e first time) - this is the prefered way for
	development, as you will often edit the files outside of 
	you need to copy the folders for it to actually sync.

Dictionary / Languages - 

	Dictionary items suffer from a double save bug - 
	that is when you make a change and click save - usync doesn't get
	passed the change, clicking save again, causes usync to get the change
	and store the changes.

	the changes are not replicated upon change - this is because dictionary
	items only fire a saving event not a saved one.

DocTypes - 

	All bits of doctype are replicated and can change. 
	Tab sort ordrer is maintained. 

	The order of properties within a tab is not maintained. 

	changing a property type will be replicated but if it changes
	the underling datatype it may cause issues.

MediaTypes - 

	Media types are less evolved - import works,
